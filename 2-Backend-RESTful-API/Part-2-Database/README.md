# Database

In this section we'll create tables in the database via our .NET CORE project.
We'll have a one to many relationship between `Canvas` table and `ColorData` table.
One entry in the `Canvas` table represents a entire canvas. Each canvas would have 32 x 32 related entries in the `ColorData` table to store the color value of each cell in the canvas.

Look at the databse schema below and make yourself familiar with it.

![DatabaseSchema](Images/DatabaseSchema.png)

This is not the complete schema. We will extend it later on and add another table called `HistoricalData`. Which will store a complete history of each canvas. However, this should be sufficient to get all the basic features.

Now let's jump to Visual Studio.

## 2.1 Create tables

Create classes called `Canvas.cs` and `ColorData.cs` under the `Models` folder.

![database](Images/image1.png)

Add the following code to your `Canvas.cs` file:

```C#
public class Canvas
    {
        [Required]
        [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]
        [Key]
        public int CanvasID { get; set; }

        // foreign key to Color Data
        public ICollection<ColorData> ColorData { get; set; }
    }
```

We have one entry in the Canvas table, namely `CanvasID` ( which is the primary key). Each attribute also has a `get` and `set` method respectively, this allow us to read and update the respective values. The `ICollection<ColorData> ColorData` makes the one to many relationship between the `Canvas` table and `ColorData` table.

> `[Key]` denotes the primary Id that is used to identify the row of data. This annotation isnâ€™t strictly needed if your variable has Id in the name, because by convention, a property named Id or <type name>Id will be configured as the primary key of an entity.

> `[DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]` annotation tells the database that we want this attribute to be automatically generated when we add a Canvas to the database and it is the primary identifier. More information can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties?tabs=data-annotations%2Cwithout-nrt).

> `[Required]` annotation tells the database that we don't want this entry to be left blank.

Use the lughtbulb icon to fix the import issues.
You will need to import the following:

- using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
- using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;

![database](Images/image3.png)

Now, add the following to the `ColorData.cs` class:

```C#
 public class ColorData
    {
        [Required]
        [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]
        [Key]
        public int ColorDataID { get; set; }

        [Required]
        public int RowIndex { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public int ColumnIndex { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public string Hex { get; set; }

        // 1 canvas has many ColorData-s
        [Required]
        public int CanvasID { get; set; }
    }

```

Again, we are using `[Required], [Key] and [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]` annotation for the primary key of `ColorData`. We are also creating a field for `RowIndex` ( this will store the row index of a cell in a canvas), `ColumnIndex` ( this will store the column index of a cell in a canvas), `Hex` ( this will store the hex code, which is the color code) and `CanvasID` ( this is the foreign key field ).

Use the lightbuild icon to fix the import issues. We will need to import the same things as we did in `Canvas.cs`.

![database](Images/image4.png)

Now, all we need to do is add these classes to `ApplicationDatabase.cs` class.
For that, open `ApplicationDatabase.cs` and add the following:

```C#
public DbSet<Canvas> Canvas { get; set; }
public DbSet<ColorData> ColorData { get; set; }
```

At this point your `Application.cs` class should look like this:

![database](Images/image6.png)

## 2.2 Windows

If you are on a Mac skip to the Mac section. <br>
Open the `Package Manager Console`.

![database](Images/image7.png)

Then write `Add-Migration InitialMigration` in the `Package Manager Console`.

![database](Images/image8.png)

This will create a migration throught which we'll be able to add the tables to the SQL database.

You will notice the following Migrations folder in your solution.

![database](Images/image9.png)

Now, type `Update-Database` in `Package Manager Console` to the update your SQL database.

![database](Images/image10.png)

Now, you have successfully updated the SQL databse.

## 2.3 Mac

If you're on a Mac open `Terminal` and navigate to your project folder.

Then write `ls`, make sure you see the following files in your project director: `phase-2-back-end/ phase-2-back-end.sln`.

Then write ` dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration`. This will make a migrations folder in your project solution.

This will create a migration throught which we'll be able to add the tables to the SQL database. You will notice the following Migration folder in your soluton.

![database](Images/image9.png)

Now, type `dotnet ef database update` in `Termial` to the update your SQL database.

This table shows the difference between the commads of donet CLI and PMC (Package Manager Console).

![database](Images/image11.png)

Congratulation, you've have successfully created the basic database.
